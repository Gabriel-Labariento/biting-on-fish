        with anyone other than my instructor or the teaching assistants
        assigned to this course.
        We have not used Java language code obtained from another student,
        or any other unauthorized source, either modified or unmodified.
        If any Java language code or documentation used in our program
        was obtained from another source, such as a textbook or website,
        that has been clearly noted with a proper citation in the comments
        of our program.
